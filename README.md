## Tasks

<br/>

**Task 1**
> Square roots are difficult to calculate. In Python, you typically use the power operator (a double asterisk) or a package such as 'math'. In this task, you should write a function 'sqrt(x)' to approximate the square root of a floating point number 'x' without using the power operator or a package.
>
> Rather, you should use Newtonâ€™s method. Start with an initial guess for the square root called $z_0$. You then repeatedly improve it using the following formula, until the difference between some previous guess $z_i$ and the next $zi+1$ is less than some threshold, say 0.01.

<br/>

**Task 2**
> Consider the below contingency table based on a survey asking respondents whether they prefer coffee or tea and whether they prefer plain or chocolate biscuits. Use 'scipy.stats' to perform a chi-squared test to see whether there is any evidence of an association between drink preference and biscuit preference in this instance.

|         |         | Biscuit   |       |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
|         |         |Chocolate  |Plain  |
|**Drink**| Coffee  |   43      |  57   |
|         |  Tea    |   56      |  45   |

<br/>

**Task 3**
> Perform a t-test on the famous penguins data set to investigate whether there is evidence of a significant difference in the body mass of male and female gentoo penguins.

<br/>

**Task 4**
> Using the famous iris data set, suggest whether the setosa class is easily separable from the other two classes. Provide evidence for your answer.

<br/>

**Task 5**
> Perform Principal Component Analysis on the iris data set, reducing the number of dimensions to two. Explain the purpose of the analysis and your results.

## Project 

* The project is to create a notebook exploring classification algorithms applied on the iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.
* In your notebook, you should first explain what supervised learning is and then explain what classification algorithms are.
* Describe at least one common classification algorithm and implement it using the scikit-learn Python library.
* Throughout your notebook, use appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams to explain the relevant concepts.
