    ">Describe at least one common classification algorithm and implement it using the scikit-learn Python library. Throughout your notebook, use appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams to explain the relevant concepts."

    "#### Iris data Set \n",
    "\n",
    "Iris is a genus of 260â€“300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers. It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris. Some authors state that the name refers to the wide variety of flower colors found among the many species. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis'. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n",
    "The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes, often known as the 'Hello world' in the field of data science. The Data set is used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.\n",
